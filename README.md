Investment Banking: C# Backtesting Engine on Equity

[ Challenges ]
In Investment banking testing different strategies, and evaluating risk is an important element in trading operations. Such strategies have to be correctly implemented, quickly integrated and modified to changing market situations. While numerous backtesting software exist already, the challenge is to develop a unique C#/.Net approach which is universal in it's approach, but sophisticated with it's models.

[ Objectives ]
Develop a backtesting software in C#/.Net programming language, which allows fast implementation of strategies, and testing of strategies.
The software is used to trade real financial instruments, not crypto.
Introducing students to professional financial trading companies in Paris. 
Introducing students to Investment banking.

[ Current Tendancy - Quantify Objective Value ]
Numerous software applications already exist. There is a trend to detect trends with quantitative analysis, and risk benchmarks. 

[ Main Goals to Achieve ]
Trading software will allow sophisticated analysis, and benchmarking of strategies. Choice of programming language will allow easy transfer into existing applications. 

[ End of Project Goal ]
Development of software prototype to backtest strategies, in C#/.Net. Th main goal is to give a Proof of Concept.
